## Introduction (pg 1)
#### Chapter Summary:
Where Nkrumah lays out a definition of the Colonial Student as a "selected" and "indoctrinated" individual who learns the colonial philosophical chosen works abstractly. He contrasts this Colonial Student with the "Ordinary African" who, when they study theory, they are thinking about it in terms of application and liberation from imperialism.

#### Chapter Summary:
TODO: 


#### 1. Modern philosophies are rooted in contemporary struggles
* A. Critical study of past theories _should_ lead to modern theories
* B. Studies of both philosophy and history may be perverted for the colonial student
    * i. Colonial student is removed from their own society
    * ii. The only worthwhile history taught by imperial powers is that of Europe
    * iii. _Certain_ African intellectuals are drawn to the imperial versions of history and become alienated from their own societies
        * a. the "universalism" in the European histories is part of the attraction


#### 2. The "ordinary African" student will value Marx and Engels
* A. Marx and Engels deal with _social contention_ and are therefore relevant to the present conditions in the colony
    * i. there's thought in these works that can assist in the fight against colonialism
* B. Nk. sees philosophical systems in the context of the social milieu that produced them
    * ii. Viewing philosophy in such context is not the only way to study it


#### 3. We can see the history of philosophy in various ways, in terms of the type of problem being dealt with
* A. Series of "abstract systems"
    * i. this view may not have anything to do with life
    * ii. (pg 6) "moral philosophers" would argue that morality or character improvement are neglected in this view
    * ii. this view focuses on the meaning of terms, status of moral principles, in terms of obligation

#### 4. Series of Abstract System view is concerned with two fundamental questions
* A. "What there is"
* B. "How 'what there is' may be explained"

#### 5. Answering "What there is"
* A. Sets general ideas under which every item must be categorized
    * i. doesn't name the specific items
    * ii. doesn't give an inventory of items
* B. Gives "basic types" of objects
    * i. reductionist: every object can be categorized into a "basic type"

#### 6. Example 1 of this categorical thinking: Thales
* A. Thales stated that "everything is water"
    * i. either directly or can be made from water as the sole raw material
* B. Thales recognized only one basic substance and everything comes from that

#### 7. Example 2 of this categorical thinking: Berkeley
* A. Berkeley stated that the world consists of spirits and their ideas
    * i. Every item is a spirit or an idea possessed by a spirit
* B. Nk. states that all items are still possible under either Berkeley's or Thales' systems
    * i. however, all items can be reduced to these fundamental concepts, e.g. water, or spirit / spirit-idea reducible
