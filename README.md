# book-reasearch-notes
A place to put notes from books I'm working through, often on stream. Generally will keep these in markdown documents.


## Currently Reading:

### Consciencism by Kwame Nkrumah, (1964)
Kwame Nkrumah (see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Nkrumah)), first Prime Minister and President of Ghana, decolonial philosopher and Pan-Africanist, lays out his personal philosophy in this book. 

## Usage
Feel free to use my notes, though I can only vouch for them as my "best efforts" to understand the works of the authors. This is not to say I don't intend on due diligence, just that I am very capable of misunderstanding and making mistakes.

I will do my best to annotate page numbers for verification.

I will also put my thoughts and impressions in the notes, which are obviously subjective and prone to my own very human error. In these cases, I may use a highlight color or some other clear-as-possible method to indicate that something is my thoughts or impressions. I believe strongly in the utility of extrapolation.

## Goals
My primary goal here is to learn. Cheeky, I know. In some cases, I may go further and make a short video essay using some of these materials as support and reference. This really depends.

Currently, my topics for this repository are focused around decolonization, social justice, history, and other less technical topics. For technical topics, I will tend to be more oriented toward creation of curriculum in its own repository. I will always do my best to reference sources and give attribution, regardless of the materials, because I don't want to be a jerk, spread misinformation, or plagiarize.
