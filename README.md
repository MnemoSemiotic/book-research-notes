# book-reasearch-notes
A place to put notes from books I'm working through, often on stream. Generally will keep these in markdown documents.


## Usage
Feel free to use my notes, though I can only vouch for them as my "best efforts" to understand the works of the authors. This is not to say I don't intend on due diligence, just that I am very capable of misunderstanding and making mistakes.

I will do my best to annotate page numbers for verification.

I will also put my thoughts and impressions in the notes, which are obviously subjective and prone to my own very human error. In these cases, I may use a highlight color
