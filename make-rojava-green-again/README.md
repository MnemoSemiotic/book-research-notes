## Social Ecology: A look at humanity and nature

#### 21st century crisis
* Hunger and poverty are marginal news
* Environmental issues seem secondary


#### Ecological crises is most urgent challenge of our time
* policy must be ecological to address these issues


#### Ecological crisis and societal crises intimately linked


#### Need identify decisive moments of social change leading to break between nature and society
* need to be concrete in this study


#### Requires a unifying critical theory
* Humans can be a great contributor / stewards of the natural world
* Must overcome division between humanity and nature


#### Contributing Philosophers and Thinkers
* In Particular: Abdullah Öcalan, Silvia Fedirici, Friedrich Engels, Murray Bookchin


#### Not a single societal relationship with nature
* Different modes of production, social classes, cultures, genders, etc
* Individual relationships with self, and external world perception


#### Current relationship with nature detm'd by current state-capitalist structure
* Must recognize a long process of changes.
* Failure to analyse history leads to appearance of inevitability, and inability to construct the future


#### Posit society as developing from small communities of clans
* <span style="color:orange">Thoughts: there is quite a bit of contrary argument to this statement. See Graeber's "Dawn of Everything", and other recent anthropological and archaeological works on the topic</span>
* _natural society_: ran according to principles of ecology, harmony with nature and each other


#### Posit that Early societies lived in harmony with nature and each other
* Nature was something living
    * All things had a soul
* Humans didn't try to conquer nature


#### _Natural Society_: "a spontaneous form of an ecological society"
* "Mother Nature" traced to a collective memory and experience


### "The Rule of Man over Humanity and Nature"


#### Peoples' relationship with nature changed over time
* First there was collecting of plants and fruits, then hunting
* Hunting culture dev'd and progressed beyond self-defence
* "War Mentality" emerged in parallel to categorical divisions (race, gender, etc)


#### Emergence of management of agricultural systems
* develops of understanding of biology leading to increased agricultural yields


#### Administration of Social Wealth Connected with Emergence of Social Hierarchy
* Already dominion of old over young, men over women, leaders over led
* State structures legitimized by mythological systems
    * priest ruled over society


#### Counter-Revolution Against Natural Society
* Starts in Sumerian society
* Develops from free and ecological co-existence toward hierarchies and people alienated from nature
* <span style="color:orange">Thoughts: I disagree with this. From our present stance, we don't have a lense into the plurality of past societies, and so we should be careful to not project present autocracy on them.</span>


#### Idea of nature as merciless, oppressive, dominating
* Rooted in break from nature
* Idea that the sacrifice of the enslaved is necessary in order for humanity to free itself from the oppression of nature


#### the Reformation in Europe led to end of treating nature as something inert
* Emergence of rationality and the everyday
* God lives in an animated nature
* <span style="color:orange">Thoughts: I don't think there was a single understanding of nature in Europe prior to the Reformation, seeing as there was a diversity of people, thought, etc., as well as diverse relationships with environments.</span>


#### Concurrently, women are demonized
* Social knowledge systems of natural healing, attributed to women, are attacked
    * from Reformation to Inquisition, and further
* Attack on women is an attack on social bond with nature


#### Colonialism subjected Global South to similar exploitation and "centralization of social knowledge"
* Simultaneously, Europeans are reminded of the _natural society_ by exposure to indigenous relationships to nature and freedom


#### Further destruction of society's knowledge of ecological processes
* centralisation of agriculture
* expropriation of peasant land
* migration to cities
* D. private ownership


#### Transition from holistic world view to mechanistic worldview of positivist ideology (38)
* greater understanding of biological processes
* Humanity centers itself
* Nature (incl human body) is considered inert (for research, exploitation, and commodification)


#### War, violence, domination, oppression are viewed as natural and inevitable (pg 38)
* where control comes through deferral to authoritarianism (ala Hobbes)
* where only individual reason can discipline instinct and nature


#### Duality of Human and Nature persists in the reversal of Nature v Human antagonism (pg 38)
* Bourgeois Enlightenment rebrands nature as innocent, humans as antagonists
    * Society as the enemy of nature
* Primitivist understanding, where society, civilization, technology, are "the problem"
* This perspective persists the nature v humanity duality


#### Positivist Science conception of nature detms human v nature relationship under capitalism (pg 39)
* _positivist science_: empirical and sensory, with reason and logic derivations (generally, wiki)
* leads to more centralized social systems, incl modern nation-state
* impact and ecological damage is irreversible


#### "The Capitalist Modernity: Profit and Enrichment as the Meaning of the Existence of All Life" (pg 40)


#### _Capitalist Modernity_ (pg 40)
* person alienated from nature is alienated and destructive to self
* Human and ecological crises go hand in hand
* life itself is commodified


#### Constant expansion is necessary to Capitalism (pg 40)


#### Growth is the ever-expanding increase in profits (pg 41)
* ignores happiness
* imperialist, all-consuming, nature-destroying


#### No moral limit to maximizing profits (pg 41)


#### No economic incentive to things not commodifiable (pg 41)
* ecological crisis creates new "opportunities" under capitalism
*  <span style="color:orange">thoughts: necropolitics in the times of Covid have been an opportunity for those least affected</span>


#### Overcoming capitalist modernity is necessary to the development of a democratic-ecological society (pg 41)
* mentality
* methods of production
* restoring balanced relationships betw humans and nature


#### "... Necessary to combine the fight for the environment with the struggle for a general social revoluttion ..."(pg 42)


#### LEFT OFF ON Social Ecology as a way out of capitalist modernity (pg 42)
